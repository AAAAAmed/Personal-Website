## First Blog
This is my first time writing a blog.
I started this blog to practice my writing a bit and maybe to have a place to share devlogs and stories that I can link to easily.

I think it would be fitting to write my first blog post/devlog about this blog system I created. *Don't you?*
(It's not just HTML)

### Why not just HTML?
It would make sense for most people to think that if you're making a web blog, you should write it in HTML (or whatever framework you use to make websites).

The problem with using HTML is that it's too werid and ugly in plain text.

The tags aren't very intuitive, and they add big bulky blocks around all of the text. It's also really slow to type it out and edit it if you don't use a code editor.

### So what else do I use?
Markdown.
