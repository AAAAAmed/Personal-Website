        <h3 class="margin-bottom-0">Traider</h3>
        <p class="project-date">25/03/20</p>

        <p>An AI powered negotiation game. Try to convince an AI to trade their <em>very fancy fish pen</em> for your paperclip. There are multiple AI personalities to choose from as well!</p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-0">Scratch Calculator</h3>
        <p class="project-date">25/02/07</p>

        <p>A basic calculator made in Scratch. It's more complicated under the hood than you might think, as Scratch's text manipulation features are extremely basic. The calculator handles order of operations and works with negative and decimal numbers (although you can't <em>input</em> decimals).</p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-0">Terrible-Time</h3>
        <p class="project-date">21/01/03</p>

        <p>An intentionally bad game, made for my first game jam (the theme was <em>'Once Upon A Terrible Time'</em>). Made in Unity, web version and a windows build are available.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-0">The Blue Dot Knight Part 1</h3>
        <p class="project-date">18/12/07</p>

        <p>This was probably one of the very first things I coded on my own. I'm glad I didn't delete this one (it's still on my old scratch account!) The game isn't great, and I called it <em>'Part 1'</em> as well, expecting myself to make a sequel.</p>
