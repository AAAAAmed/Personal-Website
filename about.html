        <p>My name is Ahmed, I really like programming and video games!</p><br>
        <p>I started programming when I was ~9 years old on Scratch where I made a bunch of little games. I still have my <a href="">first Scratch game</a> publicly available to play!</p>
        <hr>
        <p>At the time, I mainly played Mario & Kirby games, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Will_Wam/">Will_Wam</a> & <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/griffpatch/">Griffpatch</a>'s games on Scratch (I can't count how many times I've played through <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22620682/">The Ninja</a> games).</p><br>
        <p>Now I play more video games, you can see what I play on my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaaaamed/">Steam</a> profile. I also still play alot of Nintendo games. I might make a 'games' page on this site to record what games I have played and want to play.</p>

        <p>My coding projects now are just things that I find interesting or fun. That's also the reason I haven't published many new projects recently, I get distracted by some new interesting thing I found and I start a new project. I really don't know how many dead/abandoned projects I have. Thankfully, I save all of my old code, so I could go back to any project and continue/finish it but I really don't want to look back at my old horrible code :[</p>
